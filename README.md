This project was done back in 2024.


This project aims to increase efficiency in segregating waste and help separate different types of waste. Efficient waste management helps optimize waste collection and management processes, leading to more efficient and sustainable systems. They enable the segregation of different types of waste, such as biodegradable and non-biodegradable, at the source, making it easier to process and recycle the waste materials. By reducing the labor needed to segregate waste materials, this study helps reduce the overall waste that goes to landfills. 

The following materials are used:
●	MB-102 Breadboard
●	Uno R3 Board
●	Servo Motor (SG90)
●	MQ135
●	Inductive Proximity Metal Detector
●	Ultrasonic HC SR04 Sensor
●	Capacitive Proximity Sensor


In line with this, you are free to contribute in anyway that would optimize the way the code is written.
